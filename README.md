Code, SQL, and notebooks from my PhD work on Arctic water isotope data from the MOSAiC expedition (CiASOM project).



This repository contains:

\- Processed isotope datasets (Excel/CSV) in `data/processed/`

\- Python scripts for loading data into PostgreSQL in `scripts/`

\- SQL views and analytical queries in `sql/`

\- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, visualization, and geospatial mapping in `notebooks/`



A more detailed README is coming soon.
